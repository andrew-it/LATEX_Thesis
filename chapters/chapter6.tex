\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

Over the course of the work on this thesis, a translator from SLang AST to C source code, which generated code based on fundamental programming paradigms, such as imperative, procedural and object-oriented programming, was implemented.
In the future, it is planned to introduce such paradigms as contract programming, functional programming, and many others, of those which are supported in SLang, until all features of this language are covered.

The resulting translator is quite perspective due to architecture allowing easy addition of new target languages.

The translator was tested on code snippets prepared in advance, having shown that semantic equivalence between the source and the target is respected, with some amount of assumptions.
